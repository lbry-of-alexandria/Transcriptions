GARY VEE
This episode we talk IG law.
India given to the show.
Jared S I have an app idea with my target market willing to test it but I need to create an app and I'm not a programmer any advice on the time I probably got about 30-40 of these emails a week I'm not sure if you're trying to get on the show or if you really mean it this seems like the simplest thing to do in the world I mean meetup.com has 800 different developer meet-ups and if you want it bad enough you go to the closest one even if it's 75 miles away there's just 8,000 communities of developers out there.
I get an email from somebody saying hey I got the next big idea but I need a developer literally immediately I don't like this let me just catch up later love to show you're the best person I've ever met by the way I have a big-time idea except I need a developer business if you are not capable if you're not capable of finding your business partner developer then how in the world are you going to win in business ideas are shit executions the game let's move on.
Christopher S Garey how can I prevent Angel Investors interested in investing in my Enterprise for potentially stealing r i p.
Christopher this is really interesting Monday Morning Show Christopher this is also a ship question.
Ideas of shit executions the game people walk around Gary please sign this NDA before I pitch you my ideas an angel investor let me let me let me reenact it gets that later hey Gary really big fan of your best guy I've ever met and sign the end because I just can't let you see it I don't want it stolen great delete out of business if you literally thinking 2015 that your idea is so profound and nobody is ever thought of it that when I sit with you and I put your know you're a dope but I'm going to take this idea and give it to somebody else you are lost in the reality of the marketplace again if that is where your mindset is at I just don't see that as a winning mindset for 2015 and Beyond the days of Patton or idea I pee and every idea has been thought about there's nobody.
Every ideas for all of them every one of them executing or having the pieces in place to be able to ask you or the right time in their career resource energy skills opportunities those are the variables not the ideas.
The nasty show.
How do you distinguish between idea people and doers is there value in someone with great ideas who needs others to execute.
You know I think that one of the things that I've pounded home in a hundred episodes here is how much pride to have in being a practitioner how much I am how much I respect practicality like how much ideas are shit and execution one of my favorite quotes right so but it's interesting this question as it rolled off of India's tongue made me realize you know truth is there is value in it was a good way to put in the reasons I think I found ideas for shed and executions the game is because I think the majority people that spend a lot of time watching me fart at a place where they can afford the luxury of ideas.
Saint Paul's for sale near Lenox Pointe.
I do not have the luxury of being able to afford the ability to have those ideas for a long time I didn't have the luxury of building a company that had great video people who could come with me and take my garage sale show now you and I can't wait so I think there is a place for India and then our nation I think it is. It's a ranger people are excited.
I think that you have to have the luxury of those people I think the reason I'm heading here is I'm scared so many of your like he said I do you know you know you can't be you've got to be in the right setting to get the right value of ideas for the huge company that can afford R&D research and development you know that kind of thing you just got really lucky that your partner is so goddamn practical that he or she respects your idea skills and wants them but it is a really weird situation for ideas to to be valuable in the execution form especially for the farm and garden from a carnation.
Amanda asked I just watched episode 96 and you went off on IP I'm an IP lawyer starting out what is the future and where does IP fit.
Sorry.
Ip is Real by the way I believe attention but pendulums right so I'm very down my P I think I'm supposed to be spending that much time on it but I actually think like 12 15 20 30 or 40 years from now as I could ignore us to north of this generation don't think about it that it will become a white space and that like they'll be enough to make a lot of money in it because it's still law right I think I pee and patents fall into the category of building the biggest building in town by tearing everybody else's building and I'm so proud of him.
So take a bath because I'm so pissed I hate that.
Now I pee like you know.
Draw Mickey Mouse you look the one other people I can I get it like I think there's a place for it but I wasn't the supply and demand of amazing creative or ideas or whatever else is in a very different place to be happy thinking see the day of light down right like you want to work at a Disney or a fox or a media company or like being amazing scientists like I'm working at GE like the kickstarter has created everyone because the supply and demand alternative to the marketplace dictate a behavior going to feel different now that being said back to you being an IP lawyer I think what you should figure it out where all your upside professionally is is can you become a tastemaker a forward thinker can you figure out how you now can you figure out a version of becoming the IP lawyer 2.0 like what the future of Ip question of the day.


JACE
This is probably one of the most profound questions that I've ever heard somebody asking hits the nail right on the head with the Library of Alexandria project is about how the marriage of brand marketing and creatives can.
Evolve creative Industries across the board from musicians to artists to writers to inventors to programmers to teachers all all of these creative Industries.
Can be evolved if we are willing to let go of something like our idea of intellectual property as it has been defined for literally everyone alive none of us had a say in the definition of intellectual property and I think Gary V hits hit the nail on the head with what does intellectual property 2.0 look like what would being an intellectual property lawyer look like.
Taking that to the next level what does leveling up IP look like and I think that that is literally going to evolve an industry that has been desperately trying to evolve it's going to take it to a level that we have been told not to be comfortable with you seen for over a hundred years marketing and distribution.
I have had a marriage now in this second and third Industrial Revolution we have.
The internet that Gary Vee talks about all the time that is redefined marketing to put branding at the Forefront Forefront of import when it comes to having a marketing strategy if you don't have a brand you will be forgotten this is something that over a hundred fifty years ago intellectual property law specifically copyright Square setup to remedy the fact that you know how do we protect creatives when there is no efficient way to have their brand recognize this was something that was a big threat then but Gary V talks about now that there is no shortage of gaining awareness that there is plenty of space on the internet for people to have Global access immediately and with proper branding you bypass the knee.
For copyright this is something that intellectual property lawyers understand about copyright and especially patents and stuff like the Silicon Valley sevens patents are such a joke now that it's now it's getting that brand awareness to marry you with being first in the mind with the audience of the consumers with your product that way you don't need a patent to have the same results as a patent this is the same thing that is applied to creative arts I mean nobody is going to draw Mickey Mouse and think that you came up with Mickey Mouse.
Like even if they do even if you were to raise a child that thought that you created Mickey Mouse eventually going out into the world unless you sheltered them for their entire life they would eventually figure out that you're a lawyer sorry that you're a liar that was probably a Freudian slip I forgive.
I'm just messing up left and right but I seek the Forgiveness of any lawyers.
That might have taken offense to that but.
There's an evolution of intellectual property that is coming that is going to remedy the knee-jerk reaction of you know companies like Disney who when they saw the internet coming they like almost everyone in the 90s thought the internet was a fad and when they created the internet intellectual property laws that we have now for copyright especially content distribution they were made with the idea that the internet would be a fad.
Trying to put as much emphasis on that as I can it was not their intent to make internet piracy what it is today it was their intent to protect their interest on a platform that they saw no future in if they saw a future in it.
They wouldn't have been beaten to the punch by companies like Netflix.
Why companies like Hulu.
By the TV companies who mimicked Netflix and Hulu with their cable boxes the fact of the matter is the distribution marketing companies that were married to Hollywood didn't know how to compete when every kid in their pajamas can copy a movie or a TV show.
Easier than they've been able to for a hundred years it was blowing their mind this is the same time remember the people thought the internet was email this is very very tough for people to remember and wrap their heads around because they didn't understand it at that time let alone now but they thought the internet was a fad so there's no problem in making a distribution method completely illegal if you think that it's going to die and then what happened it didn't die the bubble burst they thought okay we made it to the end and then they did it and they real that weight the internet is still around and then Netflix pops up Hulu pops up Spotify pops up in the music industry almost dead because Spotify was that last nail in the coffin Netflix has been killing the movie industry but they're pivoting trying to make your own.
Distribution channels for what people don't realize.
Is that Spotify takes out all of the middlemen for musicians meaning you don't have to have a label to have mass distribution what Netflix has Todd Disney and what Spotify and you know iTunes and the Hollywood is learning from the music industry is it they have to Pivot to try and survive so what they're going to do is great you know Disney Flex what this means is that intellectual property attorneys are either going to.
Keep on the status quo where they can make a lot of money or they could be at the Forefront of an entirely new intellectual property industry something right now that is yes illegal.
Because piracy to whatever extent.
Is now attached to internet sharing it is no longer about stealing it's about internet sharing and after a long propaganda campaign from companies like Disney and others they have convinced us that sharing is stealing when we are sharing their things in a way that is much easier then copying a movie by having to VHS players to getting cassette tapes and you know you have to physically hand it to somebody and when you can digitally hand it to everyone online they don't know how to just they can't let that go what it means is their industry is dying.
In Hollywood doesn't want to Pivot in the way that everyone else in Tech is pivoting.
Like Silicon Valley they understand that they don't need patents to be successful and Hollywood doesn't want to accept that they don't need intellectual property they don't need copyright to be successful because they will make significantly less money in the creatives that they are the in between for that day or the middleman for.
The internet sharing threatens.
Their whole industry they know could become Obsolete and they will make significantly less money they will have to share it with the creatives that means the directors that means the the whole staff putting together the movie The.
The actors not just the brands that they own in you know very creative ways but they pay very well so nobody complains about them being controlled by the studios and somewhere this internet sharing Revolution that can happen.
Is going to tear down copyright as we know it it's going to tear down patent laws as we know it and then don't intellectual property lawyers on the Forefront can help us recreate the Internet Property what it means intellectual property and turn it into internet property in a way that actually protects the creatives where the Distributors now don't bring value by just Distributing their content to the world every creative has that at their fingertips if they don't provide value real value.
Then why do the creatives need them if they could fail on their own why would they want to risk failing at the hands of somebody else who owns their intellectual property.
Show the fact of the matter is is intellectual property needs to be redefined I think to the point where almost what we consider internet piracy now becomes regular viral marketing shareability if people aren't afraid to share content because they think they're going to go to jail for sharing something or reposting it somewhere that they're not sure if just giving the Creator credit is enough.
What we need is people in between marketers and intellectual property you know lawyers on both friends to help people understand that with proper branding people could essentially quote-unquote pirate your material and it's free marketing.
You can have free marketing with a proper marriage of branding and your content and giving it away on the internet.
In a way that.
Has never been possible we've been trained to think that distribution is the only way to make money as a creative when that's not even the most effective way to make money as a creative.
And if we just understood that.
This distribution marketing only benefits.
The big Distributors at the end.
Then we would find a new way that renders that useless and brings a new for front of quality content that you don't feel like you're always trying to sell you stuff and it's not about the ads your TV shows don't get canceled because they don't have Advertiser support that have you ever had a TV show that just gets canceled on the first second or third season and you find out that even though that it had a fanbase of millions they canceled it because you know you can't even figure out why that's because they couldn't get advertisers support content like that won't die audiences will be all that's needed.
To keep a show alive there won't be those middle men that say we don't care if this has 5 million dedicated viewers we need 10 million to be able to sell any product to them content will go back to being entertainment rather than a sales pitch this will improve the Integrity of the Arts.
And it will give power back to the creatives rather than the middle men.
This is the radical revolution of decentralization.
Decentralization is not just about cryptocurrency that is decentralized philosophy applied to currency decentralized philosophy is an ethical evolution of all the centralized infrastructures the vertical infrastructures that we have become accustomed to for roughly 200 years and now we have lateral organizations lateral distribution in a way that.
Brings power inherently to the creatives this is something we should be.
Demanding and every interaction we have wood Distributors that we don't need these vertical centralized Distributors any more that we can have the same success and failure with free lateral distribution with internet sharing that they want to call internet piracy we going to have the same rate of success and failure without them as we can with them.
I don't understand how people don't get that if we want the success with those vertical Distributors we have to give up all the rights as creatives.
But the internet is redefining that decentralisation is redefining that.
Let's look into this more.
Because this is.
This is I think the most profound argument creatives can have our time.
I know Steve Jobs said to you know all the creatives out there think different.
Can you hatch this is crazy.
But The Crazy Ones.
Are often the people who end up changing the world.
And when the right amount of marketers.
That are more interested in Impact than profits.
And the right combination of intellectual property attorneys.
They're more interested in human rights than Prophets.
Because freedom of speech as a creative is a human right.
In the copyright laws.
Don't protect the creators they protect the copiers the Distributors hence copyrights.
They are the rights of the copiers not the rights of the creators and this is something.
The creatives.
Aren't really explained.
So we don't get this naturally I believed just as many people do that the copyrights protect the creative cuz that's what I was told all growing up I believe your way into adulthood until one day it clipped copyrights are the rights of the copiers not the rights of the creatives.
And that's something I learned as a marketer is the proper marriage of branding and creativity is all you need.
Nobody questions if you throw a Gary V video or sound clip into a podcast or YouTube video nobody's going to question whether or not you know that guy in the video is Gary V he does great branding.
Have you talked about a Gary V subject no one's going to question.
Who are the original content creator was.
And he doesn't charge you for sharing these things I doubt if anyone who understands the virality of the internet would want to stop anybody from sharing their content as was made garyvee so successful that's why he's you know been championing branding since the 90s back when people said he was crazy and then YouTube stardom validated him.
And he's now the leading Authority on branding.
There's there's a time for an evolution and creative we have to band together to realize that we have all the tools.
That the distribution companies.
Used to make a killing with and we have them all for free now.
And they're telling us.
But we can't have what they can offer us because they're organized and we're not.
So let's organize.


NEIL GAIMAN
When when the web started I used to get really grumpy with people because they put my poems up they put my stories up with my stuff up on the web and I have to say a belief which was completely erroneous that if people put your stuff up on the web and you didn't tell them to take it down you would lose your copyright which actually is simply not true. Grumpy because I felt like they were pirating my stuff but it was bad.
I know I started to notice that two things.
Aubrey Sing Sing much more significant why which was.
Places where I was being pirated.
Particularly Russia web people with translation my stuff in a Russian spreading out in the world I was selling more and more books people with discovering me to being pirated and then they were going out and buying the real books and when you come out in Russia with someone more copies aren't I was fascinating.
I tried a few experiments and somewhat of a quite hard in a persuading my publisher for example to take one of my books and put it out for free and we took American Gods a book that was still selling and selling very well and for a month they put it up completely free on that website and you could read it and you could download it and.
What happened was sales of my books.
True independent bookstores cuz that was a we were measuring it through went up the following month 300%.
I started to realize that actually.
You're not losing books you're not losing sales by having stuff out there.
I want to give a big talk now on these kind of subjects and people say what what about what about the sales that I'm losing through having stuff copied training stuff floating out there.
I started asking audiences to just raise their hands.
The one question what did I say okay do you have a favor to water and they say yes.
Can I sing good.
What I want is for everybody who discovered that favored to win by being a lengthy book.
Clap your hands.
And then anybody who discovered your favorite author by walking into a bookstore and buying a book raise your hands and it's probably about five 10% if that of the people actually discovered an author who is that favorite author who is the best made by everything all of made by the hardback somebody they treasure the fact that this author.
If you bought the book they relented they were giving it they did not pay for it and that's how they found that they would offer and I thought you know.
That's really well this is its people lending books and you come and look on that as a lost sale it's not a lost cell nobody you would have bought your book is not buying it.
Because they can find it for free what you're actually doing is advertising you're reaching more people you're raising awareness and understanding that gave me a whole new idea of the shape of of copyright and what the web was doing because the biggest thing the web is doing is allowing people to hear things allowing people to read things allowing people to see things thing I never have otherwise scene.
And I'm basically that's an incredibly good thing.
