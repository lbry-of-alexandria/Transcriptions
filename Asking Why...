I noticed recently while I've been meeting new people on this really interesting app called shaper that there seems to be a question that systematically tends to weird out at least half of the people on it when I ask this question and it's.
Pretty unusual question.
And in a usually happens after they tell me something about themselves.
And then I follow up with this really weird question in that question is why.
Yeah it is pretty simple but I think.
A better question then why does this weird people out is why does this weird so many people out I used to think some people just weren't curious that didn't seem to add up it seemed like they were more uncomfortable than onion curious it seemed like they were uncomfortable about other people's curiosity when the subject was themselves especially their stories and this led me to really realize that it didn't matter how I asked the question even when I just you know summed it up to why sometimes it would be more elaborate like why do you think that or tell me more about that.
And if I even just reduced it to why that was pretty much the root it was curiosity about an individual and it wasn't even about super personal stuff I mean these are just you know why do you do this for work or what what why do you have that you know Vision or why do you have these plants as if it's a professional networking out why is it inappropriate to be curious about why people are passionate about something they do but the fact is it's not an appropriate but to them it feels inappropriate and I realized that going throughout most of our lives.
What are personal why is is not relevant to what we're taught in school what we're taught in college are why doesn't matter and then eventually we start to believe it.
We're conditioned for so long to only care about other people's why why they believe this happened or why they believe this is a good thing to learn or why they believe this is a good thing to do or why this is a good job are wise don't matter our personalities are bad from our conditioning work we tend to believe this we wouldn't admit this to herself but that's what the conditioning makes it feel like and then I started to look into certain things especially in the field of child psychology and I noticed a tendency that young children usually before the age of five get bullied about any number of things from children that are usually between the ages of 5 to 10 usually children that are your more older than them or in some societal bracket of seniority over them in the most common thing for children 5 and under to be.
And about.
Is why they use.
The word why so much and this comes across as children mocking other children in that mocking yyyy voice because they do this this is actually going back to the beginnings of the schooling systems why children before the age of five.
Didn't have a place in the public schooling system and what's really interesting is even science is catching up and understanding that between the ages of 3 to 5 is when the peak of human curiosity starts to fade and then systematically it goes down to the point when you're about 25 to 30 you have a 1% of the Curiosity you did when you were you know 3 to 5 depending on development and they're very very many factor pairs that go into whether or not that ends at 3 or 5 a lot of it has to do with innocence being shattered which can happen in any sort of way of finding out you have a friend you can't dress next vacation that wasn't Matt and I love the parent that spent a little bit too long from you know what you were expecting them to be in the other room or across the street for and.
You're a reality starts to crumble & Trust starts to break in this is the give-and-take of where that Curiosity starts to die so that why why why the children ask and see Singley that you know is either cute or really annoying depending the situation.
Is the same root of why an adult will look at that sort of curiosity as a bad thing the same way as a child between the ages of 5 or 10 football Kay younger child for being overly curious and one an adult does this that's why too much which only really comes down to one why when the topic is their stories not even super not even like remotely personal stuff but stuff that you know.
It's it's weird for anyone else but somebody in a position of authority over them or that has something they want it's weird to hear anybody who's just a normal person be curious about them and that's more sad and heartbreaking than anything to realize that we were condition long before we can remember.
Not even appreciate curiosity.
We tolerate confusion way more than we tolerate curiosity.
To the point where when somebody is genuinely curious about us.
The first thing that goes up.
Is our defenses not you know we're flattered or we're humbled but is this is our bulshit meter goes up and that is genuinely sad because in a world were we technically it's not even technically we pretty much genuinely know so little about ourselves until he Dome middle adulthood.
If we're pushing away people who are curious about ourselves what is that mean we're doing to ourselves if we're not curious about who we are and what we really need in life how are we going to find those answers if we're pushing away other people who have this genuine curiosity and I can guarantee that we're also going to push away our own genuine curiosity about ourselves why do I keep dating these guys why do I keep falling for these girls why do I keep trying to learn how to do this thing that doesn't serve me why do I want so badly to be with this group of people that.
Doesn't even like me.
And if we don't ask ourselves a genuine questions out of curiosity and explore that go through the depressing reality of all I'm unlikable Ro I'm unlovable we don't get to the point of oh I don't really like myself or a I don't really love myself that's why I don't like to sit down and read books anymore right don't like to spend time alone or why I always have to be talking to somebody why you know I don't like my own company anymore it wasn't always like that it was a transition because this is culturally accepted but that doesn't make it right.
Doesn't make it right.
What's really funny is the thing that's more right.
It's kind of told as being the thing that's wrong or you know then hide or you know should be feared.
But when you address these things Lee truly address these think it's going to feel like an existential crisis because reality check it is.
It is an existential crisis you're coming to know yourself your reality that you've constructed around you're so just like everyone else is starting to crumble and crack you get to ReDiscover who you are so yes it's an existential crisis which is not a mental break it's a mental Awakening.
You get to relearn who you are it was a really exciting this doesn't seem exciting at first but I can tell you from the other side is you you see maybe the value in doing it once and when you get through your leg okay good I was extremely hard I don't want to do that again but the key is to keep doing it because it doesn't get easier you get stronger and now I tend to do this every single day.
But just as you know when I was over 350 lb dieting and going to the gym was very very tedious and strenuous and as I lost the weight can as I get stronger things don't get easier.
They stay exactly just as hard but my mindset changes it feels easier it doesn't get easier it feels easier in the same thing is true when it comes to things like curiosity self-awareness or is the Eastern philosophy calls it self realization Western philosophy Closet Novi self there all sorts of Philip philosophical and spiritual ways to explain it but you know even business people talk about self-awareness the people who crush it in Industry Jeff Bezos Elon Musk jobs they're not you know abnormal humans there humans who have done the hard thing that most people don't want to do which is the hard crappy tedious chore of work.
To get to know themselves.
They did it in the difference between you know what they have in Mark Twain is no time it's realizing that it takes time to get to know yourself and how it manifests is different for different people some people you know might want to run a world-changing company.
Some people might want to.
Live on the beach in a shack surfing everyday.
There is no difference.
Between what they are capable of and someone like Elon Musk other than what they personally want to do what they personally feel motivated to do what they personally feel will have the most impact on their world some people are connected to the whole world some people are connected to their little world some people are connected to.
Them aboard in the sea matter figure out who you are stop comparing yourself to others and realize that if you stop caring if other people are comparing themselves to you you're going to repulse those people.
They're going to push you away blame it on you and your life is going to be all the better because of it.
It might even be people who are close to you now.
But imagine the damage they do in the long run because they're nice and you love them.
You can always choose who you love you can always you don't beat yourself up because of who you've gotten to know and who you've known to love doesn't mean they're always going to be good for you.
Sometimes we have to let people go no matter what kind of History we have with them.
Because it's not bad that we change just like it's not bad to fall in love with someone who's abusive is the same thing as you know loving a friend who just isn't good for you anymore they don't have to be abusive they don't even have to be mean they could just be really nice but you know they're not really Dependable it's kind of like pseudo honesty and you just really can't count on them when you know you really need a friend and you realize that you know they're nice to you but it sure doesn't feel like kindness cuz it's. Kindness tolerates absolute honesty.
Niceness does not.
People can be nice and dishonest you can't be kind and dishonest you can be kind and honest but finding somebody who's nice and honest feels about just as rare as somebody who is you know mean and honest the fact of the matter is people need more people who are rude in honest.
And the people who are nice and dishonest and feels a lot like they're mean and honest cuz they're mean but they're not wrong they're not mean.
They just don't know how to get through to you what you don't want to hear so it sounds mean because you have to say it to yourself you have to translate it to yourself and I got to tell you that is the most difficult and humiliating process I've ever went through in the fact that my wife went through it and a few months and it took me a decade.
I don't know if I'm just broken.
What.
But it works and some people and have been quicker some people it takes longer.
What time is kind of irrelevant.
It doesn't matter if it's linear or if it's acular or what it just let it happen.
Do things your own way realize that if you know what it means to be a moral person.
Trust those are still going to be a part of you when you let everything go.
Those are going to be much left to guide you through this when you're curious about yourself you let everything go everything that's right or wrong cuz you know that if you can trust yourself and trust yourself more.
You're not going to turn into a bad person unless you want to turn into a bad person and if you're afraid you want to turn into a bad person guess what you don't really want him or else you wouldn't be afraid and you would have already let go to become a bad person.
We're usually the one to limit ourselves the most this is exactly why.
Prisoners.
Have the prisoner mindset in the once they believe their prisoner they're going to stay in there and do whatever you tell them this is the same thing that held true to slaves in a slave camp.
They didn't run away not because of the fence but because they believed.
But they were a Slave.
And yeah this is it feels different than being a slave or prisoner and it doesn't have the same detailed is not exactly the same you're right.
But it has the same but different results in a manifest differently in different scenarios just like a prison camp doesn't look the same as a slave camp.
Just because we tolerate prison camp doesn't mean we tolerate prison camps and just because people and see anyway but they're the same thing.
Doesn't mean that it looks the same just as the same as if we're living ourselves and we keep ourselves in this prison of feelings based on the old bars of guilt and shame.
It's the same effect with different results and we need to let it go we need to run away from this prison of who we were with other people expect of us of what a past version of us expects of us now that we just can't live up to Let It Go.
Let It Go be curious about who you are now.
And who you are to become.
Don't give in to the fear.
Push through it realize that just on the other side of that fear just on the other side of feeling like you're going to hyperventilate.
You start to realize the truth but just because you have no idea what you're going to do for work and you really explore what you need.
The first things that come to your mind are, maybe I can just turn tricks or you know I'll go rob a store robbed a bank but really those are the negative choices the Positive Choices are well I could take a risk of myself realize that I'm not happy doing what I'm qualified to do so I could.
I try and focus more on my art or my writing or you know teaching people and figure out how to make that work but I don't want to be a teacher will I mean I guess I could tutor I like that I like the one on one and well tutors make more than teachers will maybe that's for me and you realize this happens through with feels like an existential crisis I can't do anything other than I'm qualified to do other than what other people have told me I should do what is socially acceptable.
You to you.
Figure out what your passions are learn to listen to yourself again nobody's going to tell you to do that you've got to tell yourself that you need to sit down and listen to yourself and try and have a conversation and keep in mind that you're not going to remember how to talk to yourself it's going to feel really uncomfortable and you're not going to have good things to say to yourself you're not going to have good advice to give yourself.
Until you get it all out get all the bad advice out and then you start realizing all that's left.
Is ideas.
And then they're not bad they're just ideas at that point they're just.
Stuff you need to try and figure out what's right.
Keep pushing you don't have to believe that you don't trust yourself to realize that the way you trust other people.
Doesn't work very well in the long run and you keep trusting the wrong people that's usually a sign that we forgotten how to really trust ourselves and we look for other people to play this role if we don't know how to dress yourselves how are we going to know who to trust to play this role for us.
Same thing is true with love same thing is true with friendship same thing is true with.
What we want to do in life.
We have these answers.
We just have to start listening to ourselves again.
In a world is loud and obnoxious and full of information with instant gratification as it is now it gets harder and harder for us to listen to ourselves when everyday we have hundreds of people we know and don't know.
Telling us what's right but we're the only ones that know how to find are right but first it requires letting go and listening.
And you know how to let go there is no way to explain this.
Externally you have to listen.
That is Letting Go and letting go is required to keep listening it's a continuous chain process so start the chain.
And realize it will feel easier over time because you will get stronger thank you.
