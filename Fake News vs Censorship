So this.
This topic is very very timely right now.
When it comes to topics such as fake news I think most people would consider it a newer phenomenon depending who you ask it took a rise during the most recent presidency and then the other half of most people you would ask would say that it took arise during the previous presidency some people may say that it took arise.
As the internet got popular.
Some people would say it took took arise within the past you know 10 years as social media got popular.
When in reality the history of fake news.
Is much older than that.
And fake news is more different than censorship then people even realize but it is also more similar to censorship then people are able to understand this doesn't have anything to do with how smart people are it it's literally more to do with the fact that.
It is a piece of the same puzzle where censorship is the puzzle and fake news is a piece in it fake news is something that.
Has less to do with the rise and censorship as the fact that more people are becoming aware of fake news.
Has a lot more to do with the rise in censorship and this is an interesting phenomenon because for most people think news is Dino an internet thing or something that the internet is a plague to journalism or the Integrity of Journalism or getting you know quality information but as a matter of fact there was no.
Regulatory system for free press in the early 1800s and by about the mid-1800s is when.
The media outlets at that time it was newspapers when they started to get bought out by industrialists and I use industrialist not as a socialist would but as a capitalist would use the word crony capitalists this is essentially what industrialists are industrial is have talked about this and other podcasts industrialists literally are crony capitalist.
The industry model is literally Monopoly and this is tough one industrialization is questioned you know even less than capitalism is questioned by socialist.
And industrialism is question pretty much not at all by capitalist in this creates kind of like a almost an esoteric thing of what it is based on people's disinterest in knowing what it is is not that the knowledge is hidden or somehow a cold it's it's literally people just have no interest in knowing what the difference is between capitalism and industrialism but this podcast isn't about that but it is affected by the rise of industrialism over the past 200 years and not just the modern world but the entire globe.
So where does fake news fit into this while we know that censorship has been around through tyrannical regimes all over the world since the beginning of history of the Library of Alexandria fell victim to the overthrow of the state and what's interesting is when the state was falling the state leaders piggybacked on the destruction of the Library of Alexandria because that was the only thing that was undermining their control of the people so I know I was never taught that and you know any part of my education and I thought that the Library of Alexandria was an arm of the tyrannical State and their role was to Center in Stephenville information when it was quite the contrary since they were open source research.
First to anyone that wanted to come and learn what they had no and they were an unfortunate victim to the mobs that I needed the state and didn't know the difference between the Library of Alexandria and the rest of.
You know the Empire had that time and it's how the leaders of the state ended up joining the riots to help destroy Alexandria to regain power in these these status were not the ones in control the status were actually slaves but they were very loyal to the state and they didn't like Alexandria's roll because they felt like it was limiting their ability to get taken care of by the state are there was losing control these there is some Untold Stories of History not that they are Untold because they don't exist but mostly because people don't really care about history let's fast forward to a modern example of.
Censorship let's let's look at the Nazis specifically the Nazis are pretty notorious for knowing.
How to censor information and get away with it for a very long. Of time in a way that we see is you know overt censorship they were doing book burnings and all of these things but what it is actually look like on the streets I mean most people did not Witness the book burnings in fact the people who Witness the book burnings were getting carried away to you know either their death or concentration camps are all sorts of things and most people were already dead by the time they did the book burnings.
And what's interesting is most of the time they just.
Put all the books into you know loads of trucks to take them to their you know new Library of Alexandria but would they ended up doing was taking the books that supported their caused and burning the rest so the book burnings actually went on behind the scenes so most people that were affected by the Nazis didn't even know about the book burnings until you know after the war in learning about all the things the Nazis have done this is the case not just for the book burnings but the concentration camps and all of these things by the time America got into the war they didn't even believe that there were concentration camps it was not until they were claimed Poland were they aware that okay this is.
This is much bigger than the spies predicted in.
Most of America didn't even believe the spies when they came back with pictures and mrs. this is how good the Nazis were at not just censorship but fake news what is fake news fake news is propaganda plain and simple what is propaganda well history as told and pretty much everywhere else but the United States I found out cuz I explored many universities in the United States audited many many marketing classes looked at the syllabuses and found that there was almost no mention of a man named Edward Bernays I'm at the time I wasn't looking for Edward Bernays I just remember that I saw nothing on him other than you know pretty much honorable mentions in.
History of marketing and his influence on marketing which is quite fascinating because what I found from a BBC documentary called the century of the self you can find this documentary at history of propaganda. Com this was an interesting documentary because it it shine the light on Edward Bernays in a way that you know somebody is fascinated with marketing and history as me could have gone so long without any in-depth knowledge of it really not even just end up knowledge but like any relevant knowledge Edward Bernays literally wrote the book on propaganda his first big Fanboy other than you know GM and the banks and the banks loved him because he.
Propaganda companies that at that time it had a different term it had a different sentiment to the people at that time in fact propaganda meant the same thing as PR before the Nazis but his first big fan boy was the Nazi propaganda Minister that was his you know number one thing he read Edward Bernays book propaganda cover-to-cover he was a bigger fan than the bangs Who Loved Edward Bernays for getting the masses into buying stocks leveraged by their banks in you know brokerage companies that they set up its they they loved him for that but like companies like GM and you know consumeristic companies really really liked him for helping them manufacturer once and manufacture consent.
They could compete with you know companies like Ford who were more about you know reasonable facts and things that matter did not just getting people to spend as much as possible Edward Bernays was the father of propaganda through World War 1 and World War II and then he kind of had to stop using the word propaganda as soon as the Nazis became bad guys which was.
You know he kind of felt by the banks that he helped invest in them and Market their investment in them and spread that news around you know the future of you know Germany in fact he was responsible for getting Hitler on the cover of Time Magazine because of this time he literally pulled all the strings of mass media like that's just the way things work back then he was you know the god of marketing at the top of the spectrum at that time and then after World War II he had to change is it it's quite interesting they always say that there's no such thing as bad PR.
Unless your primary product is attributed with the memory of Nazis so they're actually is such a thing as bad PR there is such a thing as bad press and Renee's experience that when propaganda became a bad word so he invented public relations Council and public relations went on the rise he started experimenting more and more with ad networks in magazines that he was helping with the celebrities that he represented represented so he also became the father of AD networks and then eventually with the help of Anna Freud which is the daughter of his uncle who inspire. All of the Bernese Ian marketing with Freudian control tactics of manipulation and Bernie's is the reason that Freud had a popular rise in America and also had.
You know a massive Fallout afterwards burnazian marketing was responsible for getting those people to hate Freud and his teachings but they were separate from it this shift happened in the seventies and eighties so what does all this mean I mean Edward Bernays is the father of propaganda which is the same thing as PR ads Were Meant to support his propaganda and PR networks that he and Anna Freud setup admin franchises for their ideology most admin didn't know why these things started the history that PR used to be propaganda all they were concerned with was making lots and lots of money that's not necessarily a bad thing but that's how somebody can be duped to using a tool that was you know used.
Successfully to a domed world domination this is something that would have called anyone's you know ethics in for realignment but this information was kind of kept from them this is how the harmony of censorship in fake news works that is when fake news as we know it in this modern era when we have more types of News newspaper that's when it really started to take off Edward Bernays was always on The Cutting Edge of new technologies as most criminals are as we know Bonnie and Clyde were some of the earliest adopters of cars you know telephone scams were what really kept the common people from wanting to use telephones in the early days same thing with the internet the internet face those kind of problems decentralized technology is facing me sort of problems now criminals are always the early adopters it just so happened in the early.
Hundreds that criminals weren't just on the bottom of you know the capital of spectrum they were also at the very very top but they were unknown they were kind of invisible to people people didn't really know about Edward Bernays until if if they weren't a Titan of Industry they didn't really know about Edward Bernays until he made an appearance on David Letterman show in the eighties and he made a joke about how he made a career of literally lying to people explaining how you know he wanted David Letterman to call him a doctor because of the principle that if he calls on a doctor people are more likely to believe things that he says.
Edward Bernays made a career out of lying to people in a way that even people like Donald Trump pants.
They can't even begin to accomplish what he was able to accomplish he created the propaganda networks the pr networks the ad networks franchised it out I'm distracting people with making a lot of money or the hopes of making a lot of money and they move up in the world of PR and advertising by how many of their ethics are able to push aside the ethical principles are able to just you know for go completely this is by Design with the ideology it wasn't some evil mastermind Edward Bernays was just interested in making a lot of money this in itself is not necessarily evil nor does it represent evil intentions making lots of money does not make someone evil as much as it doesn't make somebody a righteous person like Prosperity Gospel is preached so don't get confused that.
You know Britney's is intelligence or success is the reason for his corruption it was absolutely his lack of emotional intelligence that led to his corruption he didn't think about people in groups of one he thought about them in masses and and he thought about people as being stupid he really thought very very low of people a lot like his Uncle Sigmund Freud ended up becoming more and more like after he became homeless and penniless in the war and teamed up with his nephew who he didn't really appreciate but you know he got his book to start selling so you know what he couldn't really complain anymore but this is this is tough because the reason you know about Sigmund Freud is Edward Bernays the reason you hate Sigmund Freud is because of Edward Bernays the people who still use Freudian control manipulation tactics are the ones who.
Utilize things like NLP and marketing and AD networks and manipulate people and control people to react based on their feelings and lesser emotion and beliefs and manipulate them through control psychological control mechanisms that you no more modern psychologists work very very hard to under through these things with you no more jungian psychology your following through historical analysis instead of Freudian psychoanalysis also the reason it's considered taboo by my most psychologists now to analyze dreams is because Freud has been pretty much holy discredited when dreams have about the same relevance on reality as human consciousness so this is something where it's a subtle contradict.
Because everyone's afraid of being associated with Freud but his ideas weren't all bad I mean he pretty much Champion psychology when no one else was to give even Yuma platform to contradict Freud on for his ego and Hubris in this is just the evolution of ideas yoongi genius wouldn't really exist if you know Freud head and pave the way for people like him to even have a platform this team hand-in-hand with you know Bernie's is manipulation of his uncle to get his Works popular through controversy through what I call conflict marketing which is the heart of fake news and propaganda.
It's realizing that nothing is divinely organized nor is it evil mastermind it's just all kind of people doing what they think is best and some people doing what they think is better and conflict starting because how can you have something better than the best and this is the conflict of egos throughout time it's not that there's some evil mastermind Illuminati you know competing for world domination when in fact there are several of them in this way where it's is not some crazy conspiracy theory that works just like it does in the criminal underworld you don't have One MasterCard tail trying to sell everyone all their drugs it's a lot of people are in competition for this stuff there's not one Mastermind criminal group that selling all the drugs all the guns all the slaves it's it's groups competing with each other all.
All the time some smaller some larger some more Innovative than the ones that have gotten comfortable at the top it says it's like this in the criminal underbelly as it is in the very tippy-top of the industrialized you know revolutions that have been going on and they change faces that mean the first Industrial Revolution was British and led to the printing press which led to America and then the Second Industrial Revolution what everything I'm talking about with Edward Bernays and you know the third Industrial Revolution led to you know this Rising a new type of fake news with the internet with you know companies like Google and Facebook being at the Forefront of it so how does censorship look in this modern-day when you know fake news is everyone's well aware of fake news well in reality people weren't really aware of fake News until you know the rise of the internet but history shows us that everything that people are calling fake news.
Exactly what bearnaise built in advertising and marketing and PR in propaganda Empire on so fake news as an as it relates to now has been going on since you know.
World War 1 plane and simple propaganda was a new science of that time Bernays became the best at it and also the most corrupt and what we called fake news before we started calling it fake news was PR marketing and advertising This Is An Inconvenient Truth especially coming from a marketer when there are so many marketers in the world right now but it is the largest cult with an ideology that you know is he out as unknown as calling marketing is a cold is offencive to other marketers and I apologize if your feelings were hurt but you know taking a page from Gary Vee nobody gives a fuck about your feelings so grow up for a second keep listening if you can even if just to try and pick a part what I say and pick.
Part what's that history of propaganda. Cam you know maybe read a book or two maybe start with the and I really anything that you don't want to read and just go forward from there but you could read you know thinking fast and slow or the undoing project and give you an understanding of how to recycle analysis but you know just try and keep up if you can at this point I'm sorry if my tone upset you but I don't really care because I'm not trying to manipulate you I'm just trying to share an education that if you had known about you wouldn't be a set and if this is desperately what you've been trying to look for you're not upset and this is good news for you.
But this is why it feels like it's a war against religion but you know I find that the biggest religions in this world aren't even close to being religious in most people's definition of the word this is why I've started using the word culturism to describe how people can.
Be aware of fake news in a Danny Ainge like now but also not be aware of that fake news is anything but new and they don't want to understand that the causation between fake news is advertising marketing and PR traditionally.
That's not to say that there isn't such a thing as good marketing or ethical marketing.
Marketing in itself is a tool Marketing in itself is not bad Jack recent or sorry Jack trout and Al Ries I think maybe I mix our names up trying to fix her anyways that the authors of the 22 immutable laws of marketing that inspired you know other creative such as Seth Godin and Gary V and Jeremy Rifkin and you know Ryan Holiday Inn Robert Greene and mega Geniuses that are pushing forward what I call the ethical marketing movement that has a lot to do with terms like growth hacking that most people.
Don't know what they are most people in marketing such as myself either believe or I definitely believe for a very long time that growth hacking was just you know a buzzword but it's the ethical evolution of marketing there is a solution out there I'm not just trying to drum up fear or else I'd be no good as the conspiracy theorist that wants to solve your problems for you know you can solve your own problems by reading you know a couple of books on growth hacking I highly suggest Ryan holidays works.
But you know 22 immutable laws of marketing is a great one this is marketing by Seth Godin is amazing growth hacker marketing is a great bridge of how this took off in the digital age by Ryan holiday there is an ethical solution this isn't just fear-mongering to get you to feel like you've been due to there's a solution you don't need to feel like you're duped if you know what you just look into the solution.
That doesn't mean that you know it isn't also your choice to reject this in refuse to educate yourself further on how to be more ethical when you're contradicted which is fine I mean being a hypocrite is fine as long as you don't you know hold onto an old idea because of the discomfort of breaking through the new obstacle because the obstacle is the way and this is how we resolve the fake news problem because fake news is One Piece.
This censorship puzzle and some of the other pieces are propaganda which connects directly to fake news it's just the modern word for fake news and propaganda.
Is the same thing as PR so it's funny how they create ethical constructs for marketing and PR and advertising but the only thing that makes those FX enforceable is whether or not people make money so doing marketing and PR and advertising if your goal is to not make profit actually makes nonprofit marketing organizations the most dangerous in the world this is a very very inconvenient truth because they can completely bypassed ethical laws that for-profit marketers cannot and this should really really put people.
In a place that makes them uncomfortable but honestly all you have to do is check like when you are this is sounds extremely hard but it's not you just have to build a habit and you just have to know that you know if a nonprofit organization is promoting something they don't have to follow FX at all it's not to say that for-profit companies can't disregard ethics completely they're usually the ones that make the most money doing it so it's honestly better to just avoid marketing PR and advertising all together news is one of those things where news is actually the best way to spread marketing PR and propaganda for the Freudian control tactics because people trust news differently than they do ads but this is why we have so much more awareness.
Syndicated you know mandatory news announcements that all the new syndicates have to read a script that you just these people that you trust are reading a script and they're not allowed to tell you that the reading a script this is leveraged manipulation where they're afraid that they're going to lose their jobs if they don't do this and they can't see how it's bad because they can't see the big picture some of them can see how it's bad but they're just seen as you know not doing what needs to get done to protect the Integrity of Journalism when Integrity of Journalism is being undermined and under throw in a way that even most journalists don't have the ability to pay attention to all these details on the quantitative level that's how fake news can fly then you know it's interesting is if if I wanted to cover up.
Censorship Mass censorship I would do with the Nazis did which is use fake news use the hysteria of fake news where they actually would set up a news stations that they would take over and then create Conflict by telling the News broadcasters to say that they aren't being manipulated and make it really sound like they're reading a script so that people would argue over whether or not that news Outlet was fake news or you know corruptor you know being manipulated by the Nazis they use different terminology than we do now to distract people from the real atrocities which was mass censorship at that time that was going on behind the scenes.
And the interesting thing is the people who noticed Mass censorship during this time it was very very confusing because England was making it sound like the Nazis were no threat they were trying to negotiate with them this calm people down more than it should and gave them a reason to have cognitive dissidence to say that you know it's crazy to think that the Nazis are burning books or putting people in concentration camps it's crazy to think that it's it's probably get your your conspiracy theorist these things were literally talked about at that time when Mass censorship was going on they were quieting people up they were killing people to keep them quiet they were burning books they were making it extremely difficult to get certain types of information cuz they couldn't erase all the information I mean you could always still go to America or somewhere else in the world that had the information you were looking for but people would say things like you know.
It seems a lot harder to find the things I need to know you know it seems a lot harder to find the books that used to just be available you know it's why is it hard to find these things why is it hard to get to know certain things why is it so confusing they would talk about you know things that rhyme true with what we're going through now because I wouldn't use fake news unless I was trying to hide something bigger like Mass censorship and anybody who's been using the internet.
Regularly I'm talking about you know 20 hours a week since before 2008 even before 2,000 if you were using the internet more than 20 hours a week since before 2009. To do work but for personal entertainment that be on pornography you'll notice that the internet has become kind of a safe space where it is cultured in mega Colts online that we trust in ways that I don't remember needing to trust the internet back when it was even more useful and I see that now it's made people lazy and we'll talk about this in an earlier podcast where you know people talk about.
You know not believing everything you read on the internet but on the other hand they don't know how to verify things on the internet without somebody else or some trusted Source helping them do so they don't know how to trust but verify online and this is something that really confuse me when I was younger in the early 2000s and people were saying you know don't believe everything you read online I'm like no shit like a verified these things and I didn't realize that other people weren't doing this and what I realized people didn't learn to do it more they actually learn to do it less especially younger Generations genze would should have no excuse not to know how to verify things online if you want to crash course on how to verify things online without anyone helping you come to Libor of Consciousness. Com join the community and wipe I will I will help you do this and we can.
The course to share with people and open-source course to share with people to help educate them in a way that is easy and quick to understand on how to verify anything online because you should treat everything like it's missing formation and it can be a second nature as it is for me to verify things online I can verify things quicker than most people you know search Google for an answer for their questions and it can be this way for everyone just as you know it's difficult for kids to want to you know get in the routine of brushing their teeth.
But given enough time and practice it can become second nature to the point where they can't imagine not doing that as an adult.
And this is.
This is what's important is realizing that it's not conspiracy theory to.
Say that there is mass censorship going on we see the ingredients to it it just we don't want to believe that it's going on so we actually don't allow ourselves to comprehend the big picture we see pieces of the big picture but we won't take the time to just integrate the fact that mass censorship is going on in a way that most people don't know how to recognize and that's okay some of the smartest people in the world don't know how to recognize Mass censorship like some of the smartest people in the world presidents World rulers in Dino Aristocrats and.
Scholars and researchers didn't know how to see the mess censorship happening when it was happening during World War II.
It's it's not something to be ashamed of but these things can be taught we have learned from our mistakes and there are ways to learn how to recognize and how to integrate or you don't have to be afraid that mass censorship is happening I have more hope now than ever because I know how to keep myself save I know how to trust I know how to verify my I know how to do things that most people are so afraid to even address this reality because they don't know how to know these things and that it's really confusing and I don't blame you because.
There are so many pieces that go into this and feels like this when you address every single one of those pieces so it's realizing that you know.
I may have addressed different pieces of different times in my life this wasn't you know I'm so smart I found a simple way to figure this all out it's several several simple fixes but when in the process of doing them we have to address our hopelessness interfere in our anxiety in a way that is extremely uncomfortable until we know what we need to know to not be afraid anymore and that's the hope of this this is this is the whole point of ethical marketing like growth hacking is to help people understand how to protect themselves and their own reputation and you know.
Survive and Bob and weave in a world where scary things are going on but you don't have to be scared is just there aren't enough people saying what I'm saying so you know help me save this like come and learn and help me spread this message of hope this is what we have going on we don't have to live in a world where we need somebody else to fix the fake news problem you can put on you know the fake news spectacles and see right through the crap without having to ask anyone for help without having it to be solved on a systemic level because this is going to be like working out you know you can either delegate your sanity to somebody else who's never going to come.
Or you can take care of it yourself you can do the mental exercise to learn this new technique.
And what's interesting as is its not New because I created it I'm just regurgitating information that I wish was more popular like I really wish it was but it's not because it doesn't feel as good as buying some shiny new toy or buying a new car or buying that house you've always wanted or eating sugar or eating cheese on man Jesus so fucking good and these are these are the you know this is the Dilemma of fake news versus censorship is.
They are two sides of the same coin.
But most people for the longest longest time thought it was just a one sided coin and now they're seeing the other side and they they don't.
They don't know that right on the other side is.
Censorship and if you seen more fake news being traded on the other side of that coin is censorship and be wary because.
You know the things that are getting censored are not the things being called fake news the mass is called anything they want fake news but interesting Lee enough the people who coined the phrase the phrase fake news in today's day and age.
Aren't actually censoring the things that they're calling fake news in this is a direct contradiction for the things that are getting censored and when there was a fake news list.
It's interesting that the most powerful in the wealthiest fake news industries that we're getting labeled as fake news.
I'm still somehow survived when the the micro Outlets you know the Facebook pages the independent Publications the YouTube channels these are the things that are getting censored when I haven't heard about a single major news organization that was labeled fake news being shut down in censored completely two words put offline like completely offline to where they can't use their brand at all to spread news this is a direct logical contradiction this goes beyond hypocrisy contradiction is the dark underbelly of hypocrisy hypocrisy can be something in somebody's past approve how they've changed or contradiction is evidence of how somebody is not changing and this is the Dark Side of fake news is.
The people who are getting affected.
Buy fake news or the ones who most people don't even know who they are they have the least of thority but in the internet age everyone is kind of equal.
And you care more about the headlines than the distributor and we've been trained to think that you know fake news comes from an untrusted Source but beyond trusted sources are getting labeled fake news just as much as you know things like major news outlets.
But only one of these two are getting censored completely and absolutely.
This should raise cause because the unrecognized news outlets.
Are the modern equivalent of the Free Press.
This should scare people.
Because industrialize news isn't news because every single major news organization that has a major brand with brand recognition has followed Bernie's in marketing tactics.
And if you think this is conspiracy understand that I am a nobody brand.
And then I can be easily Stamped Out.
In ways that you know the industrialized news Syndicate they really really like to do this because they don't like to be the bad guys they don't care if it's Trump making them the bad guys and they don't care if it's the little guys making them the bad guys but I refuse to say that I'm going to fix your problems for you like you know some people that talk about big picture like to be people savior know you can save yourself like all it takes is you know education in the courage to face.
Scary stuff and I don't sell education I don't sell ideas.
All I ask is for the time your time and attention to invest in yourself to learn these things so come to Library of Consciousness. Com which is my library of Consciousness as part of the library of Consciousness project the evolution of you know journaling and blogging in add an age where people love to make playlist and come here and learn and we can spread this good idea together before it gets Stamped Out.
Because even if it get Stamped Out Now it only takes somebody else doing this later to keep this alive and it's not about me succeeding it's about all of us exceeding and realize if we want free press to come back we got to say that before independent Outlets are censored whether or not we want to believe they're fake news.
The industrialist have to put their money where their mouth is and they have to completely and absolutely sensor the big news outlets to give rise to a new Free Press.
In a day and age when journalists are not getting what they deserve and they are underemployed things like medium and podcasting and you know becoming your own Media company like Gary V talks about is all journalists need to do to have a lifestyle that's better than they could get working for one of the industrialist news organizations they have great reputations going through the past but their time has come.
If we want to see an end to fake news we have to see an end to the industrialized news organizations and restore Free Press and realizing good ideas don't need to be enforced bad ideas. So food you think is enforcing.
The independent bad idea news organizations.
It's not conspiracy you just follow the money.
The thing is is people organizing behind the scenes is literally like conspiracy is but conspiracy has become such a taboo word that all it takes is money conspiracy theory for the person who says it first to lose credibility or two sorry to make the other person lose credibility so an interesting PR hack is be first to call things conspiracy.
If you want people to listen to you over a mainstream you know Siri like denier like truth and I are.
Just call what they what their defense of the establishment that they're defending call it a conspiracy theory that they think that you don't truth is against Rick just avoid calling what you're saying the truth and instead replace that with calling what they believe conspiracy theory you'll be interested to understand that this seems like an ethical dilemma but it gives you the upper hand in a way that it's honest because the people who will say that it's dishonest are the same ones that don't want to listen when we point out truth and dishonesty and get labeled a conspiracy theorist by rearranging truth and dishonesty in a way that follows logic rather than Collective reasoning so if you want to break Collective reasoning use their tools against them and realize it's not fighting fire with fire.
It's fighting fire with water and even if you fight fire with water you're still going to have some idiots that complain about getting splashed with water so ignore the idiots and you know start putting out the flames.
