So what's the difference between centralized vs. distributed vs. decentralized explained a lot by Engineers the problem is most people who aren't in engineer don't understand that centralized and decentralized are really about who is in who has the most power whether or not that power can be centralized Beyond individual or whether or not it can't be centralized Beyond an individual this is the only part between centralized distributed networks and decentralized networks that can be interchanged the distributed part is just a mechanism it's it's really just.
A medium for exchange whether or not there is a centralized medium of exchange that uses distributed nodes to distribute this power to people or whether or not the power nodes are decentralized and nature in this distribution is literally to exchange peer-to-peer so you can't get rid of distributed networks distributed networks are neither good nor bad they are preferably neutral they are a tool for either centralized vs. decentralized we've lived throughout time having centralized power be the Pinnacle of how things get done and now we don't need that as much anymore with the the rise of the internet and decentralized tools we can now have personal property personal Brands personal.
Hour and not need a distributed form of centralized power nodes and this is really important because realizing that if centralized groups are how power is distributed through distributed networks if you get rid of centralized power sources the power only ever exist in the individual so no individual is ever more powerful than other individuals this is mind-bending to wrap our heads around but it's just the nature of if you want to go from centralized and decentralized it's it's more like a voluntaryist society the problem is is centralization has gained so much power to the point where it's almost in obscurity in the fact that it's not run by individuals or tiny little groups that some people like to call.
Illuminati and it's run by an ideology a centralized ideology that really really hates power for the People by the people so the fact is most people think that centralization at the top is.
The same as distributed centralized nodes but in reality those.
Distributive nodes only go all the way up to the single centralized power source so it's like you know Banks aren't centralized nodes they are distributed nodes on a decentralized network of currency so really there are different types of currencies for different sectors for the financial sector it's money or stop those are different types of currencies but as long as they're measured against a single currency that is the currency that is centralized everything else is a distributed node on decentralized currency Network whether or not the currency is stocks or other currencies compared to you know a centralized currency or Commodities there is really only one centralized currency all the rest are distributed nodes decentralized means it doesn't matter which one is the currency there is no V.
Currency or the company or the government there is only governments there is only internet there is not V internet there are only you know Brands there are there won't even be.
Organizations that use contracts and obligations to organize in the future it will all be voluntary on every level this is mind-boggling for most people but it's wine most people see centralization is getting worse right now because centralization has thrived by being hidden in distributed nodes that people think are the centralized powerhouses just like in the past 15 years most people weren't even aware that the Federal Reserve is a private bank and its stock is distributed against it is distributed to other banks in the United States and the world as the US dollar this is mine Benning for people simply because they they Thrive from obscurity and siloing things whether it's in the financial sector.
Or the celebrity sector or the political sector or the private-sector and public-sector it's it's really all just centralization always funnels up to one centralized currency note in decentralisation none of them are more important than others this is why people tend to think that centralization is getting worse because just as if somebody is dying because of old age the fact is is there not going to stop aging so they're going to keep aging until they die this is the same thing with centralization it's going to keep getting bigger and bigger more and more centralized which is the the proof that it's dying the fact that it's breaking down silos that you don't have the three major silos industry political power.
And.
The last one is celebrity if you the celebrity is the attention economy you know political power is power per se and Industry is you know Financial currency the fact that these barriers have been broken down more and more where you have somebody from industry going into celebrity and then somebody in industry and celebrity going into Political this is what we call hyper centralization which is just like you know somebody who is dying from old age is it going to keep getting older until the day they die and then it's over and things flip over and they switch over so more centralization is the proof that centralization is dying this is the reality we live in if it was Stronger weed have you know.
Then we probably wouldn't have had to decentralize tools pop-up this is just how things work if we live in an emotional depression but pretty much we can fudge the numbers financially to make it look like we're intellectually not in a depression at all but there's emotional evidence that we are in an emotional depression which the last time there was a Great Depression it was an emotional depression and a financial depression what's interesting is the emotional depression always precedes the financial depression so the emotional depression leads to the faith in the financial system would lead to a financial collapse this is the reality that we are in now the.
2008 it was the housing bubble then they transitioned it to the education bubble and once that pops it's all over some more centralization is proof that they are losing control it is nothing else it is just a power struggle people are trying to say that they're overthrows going on but the overthrow won't happen through political power or through celebrity power or through a financial power the the actual turn of events will be in under throw through decentralized Power which will look a lot more like personal brands that are you know YouTube influencers social media influencers these will be the people leading us the people who can crush it on Twitter not because there a Titan of Industry not because they're a political Superstar or not because they're and entertainment Superstar.
These things won't matter once things flip and this is just how centralized decentralized and distributed networks work this is why most people get confused when they see what they think is similarities between distributed and decentralized networks when in reality decentralized networks are a means of distribution so if you know we use centralized networks as the medium for exchange and decentralized networks are a medium of distribution which is why a centralized network will use a distributed Network as a means of distribution then in reality you know.
The only Power shift that needs to happen is from centralized groups to individual Brands this is the future this is why I'm very heavy on Jen Jen's he's ability to understand the value of a personal brand be able to operate in the world without contracts redefining what it means to trust human beings and work and collaborate Beyond a legal system this is this is essential this is the missing piece to make things like radical exchange work to make you know Smart Systems are binary systems like like etherium or Bitcoin of finally start to make sense in a practical way because right now we're trying to figure out how to distribute these things when it's not about an either-or thing or having a middleman distribution service that can be censored like you know a price.
The company exchange it will be a truly decentralized exchange that doesn't have a currency protocol at all tied to it like you know companies as we know them now it will just be a decentralized public service or we will do more peer-to-peer exchanges all of these things it's it's realizing that we have to let go of everything we know to understand the value of decentralization with distributed networks in the future that distributed networks will be more about peer-to-peer Gathering spots then they will be about a business model or a public service as we know it that is controlled by an entity or a group this is why it will turn things on its head and the world will go on spinning and it will get more ethical.
More voluntary and more mentally healthy overtime and interesting Lee enough jenzie will most likely be the ones to leave the way through this.
